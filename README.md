## Overview

I came a long way since January when I wrote my first lines of HTML. I'd like to believe now I'm familiar with at least a tiny fragment of web development. But I'm a career changer, so I realise most people are not gonna just believe me if I say that. I've never had any tech interviews so I'm not 100% sure what to expect but I made some research. Apparently, they might ask some questions and I don't like to go unprepared. In general, I really don't like being unprepared. :sweat_smile:

I wanted to prepare myself with some flip-cards and I thought I may as well code it myself.

## My Process

I'm practicing some vanilla skills again with this project ( it's never really enough, is it). My plan is to build a simple grid layout with different sized cards that can be flipped, questions in the front, answers in the back. At the top, there will be a searchbar to filter through the questions if needed.

### First steps


*First steps*

- I made a very simple grid layout for my cards. It's not responsive but I'm not sure it really has to be (we'll see)
- I made some research on how to achieve the flip effect I. It gave me a nice opportunity to use some transforms and was amazed to discover ```perspective``` that creates a really neat 3D effect on the flip
- Hardcoding some questions/answers
- Trying to come up with a good color scheme that doesn't put me to sleep...
Plans for next time: make a searchbar!

*Second attempt*

I added a searchbar to filter questions. I've never done something like this before so I used [The Net Ninja's awesome tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NG8zy0ywIk) for the concept and then changed it a bit to my own use. There's some clean up to do, but I'm very happy that it works! :relaxed:
Next step: I'll split all questions into categories (CSS, JS, Accessibility, etc) for easier search options. Need to work more on the answers and add different flip-effects!
