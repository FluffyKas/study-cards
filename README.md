## Overview

I've got to the point where it would be wise to prepare for interviews. As part of this process I thought I make some question-answer cards with common interview questions to practice a bit. Then it somehow turned into this small project...

## My Process

I'm practicing some vanilla skills again with this project ( it's never really enough, is it). My plan is to build a simple grid layout with different sized cards that can be flipped, questions in the front, answers in the back. At the top, there will be a searchbar to filter through the questions if needed.

### First steps

*First steps*

- I made a very simple grid layout for my cards. It's not responsive but I'm not sure it really has to be (we'll see)
- I made some research on how to achieve the flip effect I. It gave me a nice opportunity to use some transforms and was amazed to discover ```perspective``` that creates a really neat 3D effect on the flip
- Hardcoding some questions/answers
- Trying to come up with a good color scheme that doesn't put me to sleep...
Plans for next time: make a searchbar!

*Second attempt*

I added a searchbar to filter questions. I've never done something like this before so I used [The Net Ninja's awesome tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NG8zy0ywIk) for the concept and then changed it a bit to my own use. There's some clean up to do, but I'm very happy that it works! :relaxed:
Next step: I'll split all questions into categories (CSS, JS, Accessibility, etc) for easier search options. Need to work more on the answers and add different flip-effects!
