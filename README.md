## Overview

I came a long way since January when I wrote my first lines of HTML. I'd like to believe now I'm familiar with at least a tiny fragment of web development. But I'm a career changer, so I realise most people are not gonna just believe me if I say that. I've never had any tech interviews so I'm not 100% sure what to expect but I made some research. Apparently, they might ask some questions and I don't like to go unprepared. In general, I really don't like being unprepared. :sweat_smile:

I wanted to prepare myself with some flip-cards and I thought I may as well code it myself.

## My Process

I'd like to later turn this into a React app but for now (since I'm kind of eager to start practicing) I'd make an attempt to use CSS only. At the moment, I'm not sure, how I'm going to do this, but I'm fairly confident in my CSS skills so I'll make some research and I'm sure I'll manage somehow. :relaxed:

### First version: Vanilla CSS

#### Day 1:

- I made a very simple grid layout for my cards. It's not responsive but I'm not sure it really has to be (we'll see)
- I made some research on how to achieve the flip effect I. It gave me a nice opportunity to use some transforms and was amazed to discover ```perspective``` that creates a really neat 3D effect on the flip
- Hardcoding all questions/answers
- Trying to come up with a good color scheme that doesn't put me to sleep...
- Perhaps I'll add a few different flip-effects

Future plans: a nice searchbar on the top would be useful so I can look for specific questions. Never made something like this before. Time to practice some JS!
