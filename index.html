          <p class="answer">Elements with display: inline will take up as much height&width as their content, height&width properties have no effect on them. On inline-block elements on the other hand, you can change width&height.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-back">
          <p class="answer">Var is global-scoped, visible thorugh blocks. It tolerates re-declarations. They,re hoisted and initialised with undefined. Let and const are block-level variables(living <strong>only</strong> in the {...} if declared inside). An error is thrown if re-declared. They are hoised but can't be accessed before their declarations. The main difference between let and const is that the value of const can't be changed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-back">
          <p class="answer"><strong>Static</strong>: this is the default positioning, following the normal flow of the document. <strong>Relative</strong>: relatively positioned elements can be moved based on their original position in the document flow. This element won't be taken out of the flow, it leaves its "ghost" behind. <strong>Absolute</strong>: takes the element out of the document flow (no "ghost"). Absolutely positioned elements can be offset based on the entire page (or the relatively positioned parent). <strong>Fixed</strong>: the element's position will always be based on the screen. <strong>Sticky</strong>: is like fixed but instead of the screen, it's fixed to its parent.</p>

          <h2 class="question">What is hoisting?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card-back">
          <p class="answer">Before parsing the code Javascript engine shifts all variable declarations to the top of the scope (auto-initialised to undefined), this is called  hoisting. It does the same with function declarations (but they're initialised to their actual function value). Hoisting doesn't work with function expressions.</p>
